Instance Metadata service provides information regarding your running instance which can be used to manage and configure your instances on Azure. Azure's instance metadata service is a RESTful endpoint available to all IaaS VMs created via new [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/?redirectedfrom=MSDN). The endpoint is available at a well-known non routable IP address ( 169.254.169.254 ) that can be accessed only from within the VM. This service would provide important data regarding instance , its network configuration and upcoming maintenance events. For additional information See [Metadata categories](#instance-metadata-data-categories).

### Important information
Currently this service is in **preview** and hosts information regarding instance and upcoming maintenance events. Service will continue receiving updates and this page will reflect the specific [data categories](#instance-metadata-data-categories) available.


## Retrieving instance metadata 

Instance metadata is available for running VMs created/managed using [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/?redirectedfrom=MSDN). 
To access all data categories for an instance use the following URI

```

$ curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2017-03-01
```

The default output for all instance metadata is of json  format (content type Application/JSON)

## Usage Examples
Below is set of examples and usage semantics for instance metadata service

### Versioning 
Instance metadata service is versioned and the current version is 2017-03-01


```

curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2017-03-01

```

As we add newer versions earlier version will be made available incase your scripts has dependencies on data formats.


### Data output
By default instance metadata returns data in JSON (content type=application/json), however different node elements can return data in different default format as applicable , below table is a quick reference for data formats 

Element | default data format | Other formats
--------|---------------------|--------------
/instance | Json | text
/scheduledevents | Json | None

To get data in text format for instance ?format=text can be appended to the request , for example 

```
curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2017-03-01\&format=text
```
### Security
Instance metadata endpoint is accessible only from within the running instance on a non-routable 169.254.169.254 IP address. In addition, any request with **X-Forwarded-For header** is rejected by the metadata service. 
We also require requests to contain **Metadata:true** header being sent to ensure that the actual request was directly intended and not a part of unintentional redirection. 
### Error
In case of a data element not found or malformed requests Metadata Service  will return standard HTTP Error, few examples below

HTTP Return  Code | Reason
----------------|-------
200 | OK
400 | Bad Request, missing header , please pass -H Metadata:true
404 | Not Found, requested element doesâ€™t exist 
405 | Method not supported 
429 | Too many requests, currently we only support maximum of 5 queries per second

### Examples

## Availability 
The current Preview is available in **West US Central** Region of Azure. 
For trying out Instance Metadata Service simply create a VM from [Azure Resource Manager ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/?redirectedfrom=MSDN) or [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) and follow the [examples]((#Retrieving-instance-metadata ))


## Example Scenarios for usage  

### Tracking VM running on Azure 

As a service provider you may required to track the number of VMs running your software or have agents that need to track uniquess of the VM. To be able to get a unique ID for a VM simply use vmId field from Instance Metadata service 

```
curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/vmId?api-version=2017-03-01\&format=text

5c08b38e-4d57-4c23-ac45-aca61037f084

```

### Placement of containers, data partitions based Fault/Update domain 

For any big data scenarios where placement of different replicas are of prime important, like [HDFS replica placement](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#Replica_Placement:_The_First_Baby_Steps) or for container placement via an [orchrestrator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/node-selection/) you require to know the platformFaultDomain and platformUpdateDomain the VM is running on. You can query these directly via instance metadata

```

curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/platformFaultDomain?api-version=2017-03-01\&format=text 

0

```

### Getting more information about the VM during support case 

As a service provider you may get a support call where you would like to know more information about the VM. Asking the customer to share the compute metadata can provide basic information for the support professional to know about the kind of VM on Azure. 


```
curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute?api-version=2017-03-01

{
"compute": {
    "location": "CentralUS",
    "name": "IMDSCanary",
    "offer": "RHEL",
    "osType": "Linux",
    "platformFaultDomain": "0",
    "platformUpdateDomain": "0",
    "publisher": "RedHat",
    "sku": "7.2",
    "version": "7.2.20161026",
    "vmId": "5c08b38e-4d57-4c23-ac45-aca61037f084",
    "vmSize": "Standard_DS2"
  }

}
```

## FAQ
1. I am getting Bad request. Required metadata header not specified ?
    ##### Instance Metadata Service requires header of Metadata:true to be passed in the request. Passing header will allow access
2. I am not getting compute information for my VM ?
    ##### Currently Instance Metadata Service  supports Azure Resource Manager created instances only, in future we  will add support for Cloud Services VMs 
3. I created my Virtual Machine through ARM a while back, I do not see compute metadata information?
    ##### For any VMs created after Sep 2016 you can simply add a new [Tag](resource-group-using-tags.md) to start seeing compute metadata. For older VM ( created before Sep 2016) you would have to add/remove extensions to the VM to refresh metadata [linux](virtual-machines-linux-extensions-features.md) , [Windows] (virtual-machines-windows-extensions-features.md) to get metadata 
4. I am getting  500 - Internal server error?
    ##### Currently Instance Metadata Preview is available only in West US Central Region, Please deploy your VMS there.
